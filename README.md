The simulation is done using a DHT22 sensor. Initially I had thought to use DS18B20 sensor since it has got much more temperature range which it can measure. It's range is from -55°C to +125°C, which makes it a much more efficient sensor but the major problem which i faced during wokwi simulation is that i couldn't use real time analysis for measuring the temperatures. The only option was to change the values of temperature from diagram.json in wokwi which didn't match my code's algorithm.

There are 2 codes present here, one with nRF BLE the other is wokwi's simulation code. Wokwi doesn't simualte BLE or nRF Connect App so i had to use 2 different codes.
